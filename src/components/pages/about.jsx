                <p>Hey there! I am Ansh Chauhan, an undergrad student @UMichâ€™27 who loves coffee, coding, and cats. Welcome to my personal website.</p>
                <p>This website acts as a collection of all my projects and prospective ventures. I started my code journey learning Scratch (scratch.mit.edu) and progressed onto Python. I moved onto Front End Development with HTML/CSS/JS and finally ReactJS. With a high focus towards designing I tend to keep my UI/UX minimal and clean and easy to navigate.</p>
                <p>Alongside coding, coffee makes up for a lot of my daily schedule. Whether brewing French Press or Espresso, you can come over for coffee whenever. I always love a good brew at any time of the day.</p>
